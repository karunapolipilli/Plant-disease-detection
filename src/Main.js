                <p>
                    Our Plant Disease Detection System is a web-based application designed to help farmers and gardeners quickly identify plant diseases using image-based diagnosis.
                  Users can upload a photo of a diseased plant leaf, and the system predicts the disease using a trained machine learning model.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                   This tool aims to reduce crop loss by enabling early detection and treatment of plant diseases. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The system uses <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</strong> for image classification and is built using:
                    </p>
                     <ul>
                           <li>üß† Python (Gradio for backend)</li>
                            <li>‚öõÔ∏è React.js for frontend</li>
                            <li>üî¨ TensorFlow/Keras for model training</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p>
                       By simplifying disease detection, our platform supports smarter agriculture, especially in rural areas where expert access may be limited.
